The first player starts off as X and places his mark in an empty square, then
the opponent follows by placing an O in any other empty square.  The game ends
with a winner when a player has 3 of his marks in a row, column, or diagonal. 
The game is drawn when every square is filled and a winner does not exist.

When the application begins the player goes first.  Subsequent games switch
the player to start only after a draw.

h3. About: 

The game almost universal, in some countries it is better known as Noughts and
Crosses, but those countries are mistaken.
